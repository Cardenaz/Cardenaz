### Hi beautiful peoples ðŸ‘‹

ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on peer to peer laundry. 

I started to code originally because I wanted to develop Machine Learning Models, however, I don't ever recall having a pleasant or creative moment 
with it - it was sort of like I had my eyes half closed when pounding ML books or projects while having Geohot streaming in the background, and thinking that this will eventually be fun, that day never came, except the streaming part ... and I kind of got swooped into app development instead.
